# Password-Vault
Locally store login information for all of your services in a secure application

I am currently working on this application and plan to complete it in the next couple of weeks once my living arrangements have settled

The application creates a SHA512 encrypted hash of your passwords to be written to a text file stored at 
(TODO: decide file location to ensure that dir. can be written to)
